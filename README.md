# Building-Attacking-On-Huge-SF-Network-
This project is the mainly content of my master paper, containing the way of building scale free network in BA model and Configuration model, besides it contains two ways of attacking it, i.e. random attack and Localized attack.  

Attention, all the networks are stored in edge list type, cause the scale of network we're studying is very large, which can reach 10^6 or even bigger. Edge list can save lots of storage in computer. So all the algorithms are writen based on this.
